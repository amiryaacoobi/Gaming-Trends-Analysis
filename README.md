This project analyzes video game popularity and profitability trends on the Steam platform from 2000 to 2019. Leveraging data from the Steam API, SteamSpy API, and supplemental CSV files, the study examines shifts in genre popularity, pricing strategies, and revenue distribution. Advanced visualizations, including time series plots, heatmaps, and bar graphs, are used to reveal insights about the dominance of action and free-to-play genres, as well as the correlation between positive reviews and sales.
